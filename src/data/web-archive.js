In my senior spring semester, I took a “creative code” class that included an intro to Processing, and I was flown to California for a final round of technical writing interviews at Google that I didn’t get (thankfully, I think), but all of this made tech seem weirdly viable.\n\nI wound up getting hired as an Office Manager at a tiny and ethically dubious NYC tech start-up where my friend worked. My responsibilities were coordinating meetings and ordering snacks from Amazon Fresh. It was slow and boring and I hated it. It made me existential in the way 22-year-olds get existential about having a normal job after liberal arts school.
