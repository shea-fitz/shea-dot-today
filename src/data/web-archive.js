      content: `*My true first website was a Squarespace portfolio site that I built in an all-nighter over Christmas break in 2017. This site was never crawled by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/" target="_blank">Wayback Machine</a> so it’s lost to the ether.<br/><br/>

      In 2018, I had just graduated from Wesleyan as an American Studies major with a completely made up concentration I dubbed “Cultural Studies of Art” (my transcript includes utopian societies, experimental music, new media art, IP law, public infrastructure, theories of friendship, and other sincerely enriching topics that render my degree incoherent to most people). I had a work study job in the Marketing department at <a href="https://www.weslpress.org" target="_blank">Wesleyan University Press</a> throughout college, so my only post-grad job prospects were book publishing, writing, or completely conning my way into something I was unqualified for. In my senior spring semester, I took a “creative code” class that included an intro to <a href="https://processing.org/" target="_blank">Processing</a>, and I was flown to California for a final round of technical writing interviews at Google that I didn’t get (thankfully, I think), but all of this made tech seem, weirdly, viable.<br/><br/>
      
      I wound up getting hired as an Office Manager at a tiny and ethically dubious NYC tech start-up where my friend worked. My responsibilities were coordinating meetings and ordering snacks from Amazon Fresh. It was slow and boring and I hated it. It made me existential in the way annoying way that 22-year-olds get existential about having a normal job. But I was at an office every day with early-20s software engineers who clowned around, and I figured I should at least capitalize on that and learn how to build a website.<br/><br/>
      
      During lunches and slow afternoons, I worked through the <a href="https://www.edx.org/cs50" target="_blank">Harvard CS50 Computer Science course</a> on EdX.  I starting inspecting personal websites I found on <a href="http://are.na" target="_blank">Are.na</a> in the browser. I found one that had used the CSS library <a href="https://tachyons.io/" target="_blank">Tachyons</a> and another that used <a href="https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js/" target="_blank">Typed.js</a> to animate the text in their bio. Most of the code I used in my own website was copied and pasted from other people’s websites or a library. The image galleries in this version of my website use copied and pasted CSS from <a href="https://tachyons.io/components/collections/posters/index.html" target="_blank">this Tachyons page component</a>. My coworker helped me with DNS pointing one afternoon and my hand-coded website was officially deployed.<br/><br/>
      
      At the time, I identified mostly as a digital artist who did some freelance writing. My illustration work was rooted in abstract comics and experimental 3D modeling, and I was interested in getting residencies and publication opportunities. I had literally no idea what jobs I would have in the future, but I had creative momentum here, and saw it as my long-term prospect. This version of my website tried to plant that seed.`,

At this point I still felt mostly like an artist, and was getting a lot of validation for my artwork, but if felt forced and, as I started developing wrist problems, physically unsustainable. This iteration still feels like an “artist’s website,” but I was losing bandwidth to focus on anything but improving my job situation, which was really weighing on my day-to-day emotional state, so I would soon channel more energy to constructing myself as a web designer.",

        I was also beginning to feel self-conscious about a lack of cohesion in my visual work, and frankly didn’t like a lot of it. It was early quarantine, and I was working my way through the <a href="https://www.superhi.com/courses/javascript-for-designers" target="_blank">SuperHi JavaScript for Designers</a> course, and I purposefully nested all images of my work so I wouldn’t have to necessarily design in conversation with them.`,
