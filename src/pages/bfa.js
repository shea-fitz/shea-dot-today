        <h3>Client</h3>

        <p className="paragraph">
        <a href="https://blueflowerarts.com/" target="_blank">Blue Flower Arts</a> (BFA) is a boutique, woman-owned literary agency known for their highly-regarded roster of artists, historical legacy, and small-business charm.
        </p>


        <h3>Ask</h3>

        <p className="paragraph">
        BFA wanted their brand to mark a new beginning: one that mirrored a change in leadership, the diversity of their roster, and the vibrant spirit of their team. Their goal was to relaunch their website with a complete rebrand in Summer 2021.

        <h3>Research</h3>

        <p className="paragraph">
        BFA's Project Manager provided us with initial brand research conducted with the in-house team - evocative questions like, <span className="highlight">"If BFA was a physical space, what would it be?"</span> (A vintage brownstone, they said, or a cozy old victorian house). From there, we provided four visual themes to choose from, mix, and match.

        <h3>Logo</h3>

        <p className="paragraph">
        When brainstorming for BFA's new logo, we gathered visual inspiration and established ways of describing BFA that could serve as prompts for our sketching and a <span className="highlight">source of truth for what the logo should communicate.</span> 

          <ul>
            <li>BFA is like a stem supporting many flowers</li>
            <li>BFA is a unified collection of many artists</li>
            <li>BFA is an epicenter, artists are like petals</li>
            <li>BFA supports unique careers that can grow in different ways</li>
          </ul>
        
        Formal considerations that stemmed from these descriptions were:
          <ul>
            <li>Should the logo have one or many flowers?</li>
            <li>If many, should they vary in size or shape? Or be a unified system?</li>
            <li>BFA is an epicenter, artists are like petals</li>
            <li>Should the logo reference a real blue flower?</li>
          </ul>

        </p>

          <Image
          source={logoInspo}
          caption='Logo inspiration'
        />

        

        <p className="paragraph">
            <Image
              source={sketches}
              caption='Mid-fidelity logo sketches'
            />

          By associating sketches with certain phrases, we were able to <span className="highlight">guide design reviews conceptually rather than formally.</span> Instead of asking, "Which logo do you like best?" we asked, "Which logo best represents [BFA as a support network of unique artists]?" This allowed the client to come to a logo decision holistically and happily.
        </p>

        <h3>Result</h3>

        <p className="paragraph">
        Drawing from Art Nouveau, stamps and seals, and blue poppies, we arrived at a logo that strikes the balance of <span className="highlight">strength, levity, tradition, and personal touch</span> that BFA wanted their brand to embody. With the logo, we arrived at Blue Flower Blue - fresh and bright, but not corporate - and built out the full brand ecosystem.
